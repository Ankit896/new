Create a utility to cleanup the logs, please note:
- You should not be using logrotate.
- Log cleanup information should be stored in a configuration file
  - nginx_logCleaner.conf for nginx process
  - apache_logCleaner.conf for apache process
  - hello_logCleaner.conf for helloWorld.sh (custom process)
- Below are the cleanup configuration options
  - process name for which to clean up
  - path of the process log file (optional) - default should be /var/log/<process>
  - Size basis i.e 40 kb
  - Time basis i.e 0800
  - Will it be deleted or backed up
  - If backed up, how many backup needs to be retained
- The utility should run as a background daemon
- The utility must generate a log file of it's own and periodically print information
  - each time it wakes to collect
  - number of processes it is managing
  - which file it rotated
- Use the linux directory structure convention to place all the files, ie. executable script, configuration files, backup files per process, log file of this utility.
example :
./OtRunInBackground start OtLogCleaner --config /path/to/OtLogCleaner.d/
